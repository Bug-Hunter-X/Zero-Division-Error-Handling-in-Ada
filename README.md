# Zero Division Error Handling in Ada

This repository demonstrates a common error in Ada programming: the unhandled exception raised when attempting to divide by zero.

The `bug.ada` file contains code that attempts to divide by zero without proper error handling. The `bugSolution.ada` file provides the correct solution that uses exception handling to gracefully handle the division-by-zero scenario.

**How to run the code:**

1.  Save the code in files named `bug.ada` and `bugSolution.ada`.
2.  Compile and run the code using an Ada compiler (like GNAT).
